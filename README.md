A rewrite of `shark` using [oclif](https://oclif.io) is under progress [#12](https://github.com/satyarohith/shark/pull/12).

## Installation
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and then run this command
```sh
npm install -g shark
```
## Usage
To get started
```sh
shark
```
It will ask for DigitalOcean Personal Access Token for the first time and then you can perform tasks interactively.
